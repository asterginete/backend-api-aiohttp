# Simple Aiohttp CRUD API with Authentication

This is a basic CRUD API built with Python, aiohttp, and asyncio. It provides endpoints for managing resources like items, users, orders, products, categories, and comments. Additionally, it features user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install aiohttp jwt bcrypt
```
3. Run the API:
```bash
python api.py
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Registration

- **POST /register**: Register a new user.
  - Request Body: JSON object with `username` and `password`.
  - Response: JSON object with a success message.

### User Login

- **POST /login**: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token.
  - Request Body: JSON object with `username` and `password`.
  - Response: JSON object containing the JWT token.

After logging in, the returned JWT token must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests to access protected endpoints.

### JWT Middleware

The API uses a JWT middleware to protect certain routes. This middleware checks for a valid JWT token in the request headers for all routes except `/login` and `/register`. If a valid token is not provided, the request will be denied.

## Notes

This API includes basic user registration and JWT-based authentication. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored. The JWT token is used to verify the identity of the user for subsequent requests.

This is a basic example and doesn't include features like error handling and validation. In a real-world application, you'd also likely use a database with an ORM or a database driver to handle data persistence.
